# Angular Dependeny Injection transformer
A tool that automates the migration of dependency injections from traditional constructor-based injection to the new, more efficient inject() method.


```
npx transform
```
Note that this is a basic implementation that does not (yet) cover more complex or non-standard constructor use cases.

Use with caution and check the changes made by the package.
